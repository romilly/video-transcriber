## Session Summary

Fixed bug where audio transcription before the first detected visual frame was being silently dropped.

## Completed

### Bug Fix: Audio Before First Frame Lost
- **Problem**: In `_merge_audio_with_frames()`, the first frame used its own timestamp as the start boundary for audio segment matching. If the first distinct frame appeared at e.g. 5 seconds, any audio from 0-5 seconds was silently dropped.
- **Root cause**: Line 155 in `video_transcriber.py` used `start_time = frame.timestamp_seconds` for all frames, including the first one.
- **Fix**: Changed to `start_time = 0.0 if i == 0 else frame.timestamp_seconds` so the first frame captures all audio from the start of the video.
- **Test added**: `test_audio_before_first_frame_is_included` - sets up first frame at 5.0 seconds with audio segments starting at 0.5s, 2.5s, 6.0s, and 16.0s, verifies all early audio is captured.

### Test Status

### v0.3.1 Release
- Bumped version to 0.3.1 (patch release for bug fix)
- Built wheel and sdist
- Uploaded to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/video-transcriber/0.3.1/
