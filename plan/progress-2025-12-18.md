# Progress Report - 2025-12-18

## Session Summary

Focused on packaging cleanup and test improvements.

## Completed

### Packaging Updates
- Added missing `numpy` to pyproject.toml dependencies
- Removed unused `requests` and `python-dotenv` from requirements.txt
- Created separate `requirements-test.txt` for test/dev dependencies
- Fixed deprecated license format (changed to SPDX expression `"MIT"`)
- Removed deprecated license classifier from pyproject.toml
- Deleted redundant `setup.cfg` (pyproject.toml handles everything)
- Added `build` tool to dev dependencies
- Exported `transcribe_video` from package `__init__.py`
- Updated `__version__` to `"0.1.1"`

### Wheel Build Verification
- Successfully built `video_transcriber-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl`
- Tested installation in fresh venv - works correctly

### Test Cleanup
- Removed all `skipif` decorators from `tests/integration/test_audio_adapters.py`
- Removed `skipif` decorator from `tests/integration/test_opencv_adapter.py`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with guideline: "Never skip tests due to configuration issues"
- All 11 integration tests pass

### Git Cleanup
- Removed large files from git history
- Force-pushed to clean up remote

## Pending / Next Steps

### Test Data Files
- Integration tests use video files from `data/` directory (not tracked in git):
  - `data/tony.mp4` - used by audio adapter tests
  - `data/tony-short.mp4` - used by audio adapter tests (10 second version)
  - `data/cp-demo.mp4` - used by opencv adapter tests
- Need to decide: add small test videos to repo, or document as required local setup?

### Uncommitted Changes
- Changes from this session need to be committed:
  - `tests/integration/test_audio_adapters.py` - removed skipif decorators
  - `tests/integration/test_opencv_adapter.py` - removed skipif decorator
  - `CLAUDE.md` - added test skip guideline
