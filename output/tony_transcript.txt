SLIDE 1/4 - [00:00] (Frame #30)
================================================================================

📊 VISUAL CONTENT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The image shows the "Pi to Pico connection" interface, which displays the following information:

Single Pico Card
- USB-A to USB-C cable
- Serial Communication
- 5V Power Supply

Multiple Pico Cards
- Powered USB Hub & Extender
- USB cable
- Serial Communication
- 5V Power Supply

The image also shows a "Pause recording" section with options to enable recording hotkey, enable sound notifications, and configure the hotkey.

The "Information" section displays details about the recording, such as total time, FPS in/out, size in/out, file name, file size, and bit rate.

The "Preview" section shows the frame rate and notes that previewing requires extra CPU time, especially at high frame rates.

PI TO PICO

🎤 AUDIO DURING THIS SLIDE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[00:11] In real life.
[00:14] Is it. It haven't been three thirty in the morning.
[00:18] And I'm not getting up at that time of the morning.
[00:21] And I guess you guys can hear him. Okay.
[00:23] Yeah.
[00:29] So for the benefit of people, I think I've been coming along to the.
[00:33] I was running up started.
[00:36] The Raspberry Pi group for about nine years now.
[00:40] I've.
[00:41] I first started when I was visiting London about nine years ago.
[00:44] I came along one night for a.
[00:48] A pint.
[00:49] And I have participated by zoom ever since.
[00:52] Except that are getting up at this time of the year.
[00:55] It's getting up at three thirty in the morning is a bit.
[00:59] It's a bit hard.
[01:00] So anyway, I'm in London. I'm visiting London for a few weeks.
[01:03] I thought we better come along again.
[01:06] So I for those who don't know me.
[01:09] I I worth an a factory in Australia.
[01:12] As a manufacturer.
[01:14] We make cable.
[01:15] We we start off with a raw copper and.
[01:18] Make cable all the way up to, you know,
[01:21] a multi core complex hybrid cables, et cetera.
[01:24] And then turn them into the looms.
[01:26] Which going to all sorts of appliances.
[01:29] Caravans, automotive, et cetera.
[01:31] So we have this problem of of of building a loom.
[01:36] And then wanting to test it.
[01:38] So you've got a you've got a half a dozen cables.
[01:41] Half a dozen cables.
[01:42] Half a dozen.
[01:43] You know, half a dozen cables, half a dozen wires.
[01:46] Some connectors that each end.
[01:48] And you've got to make sure that.
[01:51] When you're building thousands of them at a time.
[01:54] And we've done some of them where we've done not in batches of 10,000.
[01:57] It's really easy after a while to to make a mistake.
[02:02] And when you're in mass manufacturing when you make a mistake.
[02:04] You don't make one.
[02:05] You make.
[02:07] A lot.
[02:09] And so what I'm showing here is a test set.
[02:12] For testing cables and looms.
[02:15] Now, a loom can be just a simple, you know, three or four wires connected to each end.
[02:20] Very straight.
[02:21] But it could have a T piece at T T connection in it.
[02:25] It could have a multiple connectors.
[02:28] It might be connectors on one end.
[02:30] And the other end might be just bare cut wires that are going to be.
[02:34] That stripped and then sold it into something.
[02:37] So we have all these combinations.
[02:39] So I'm looking at building.
[02:43] The next generation of a Raspberry Pi controlling.
[02:48] At a series of IO devices.
[02:51] And so.
[02:52] In this presentation, I'm talking about how I've used a pco or pcos.
[03:00] Okay.
[03:01] Get up.
[03:02] Coming up there.
[03:04] Okay.

SLIDE 4/4 - [03:04] (Frame #5550)
================================================================================

📊 VISUAL CONTENT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The image shows a "Cable Harness Test Set" with the following information:

Checking for:
- Swapped Wires - wire inserted in wrong connector hole
- Open Circuit wires
- Short Circuits between two wires
- Can accept Spliced wires (3 or more ends) or Fly Leads where there is bare wire and no connector

The image also shows two test results:
1. Testing Model E - FAIL, Error Code = 0
2. Testing Model F - PASS

🎤 AUDIO DURING THIS SLIDE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[03:05] So what I'm checking for is swap wise.
[03:09] The person is assembling it.
[03:11] Let's put the wrong wire in the wrong hole in the connector into the housing.
[03:15] We've got an open circuit.
[03:16] The pin hasn't been connected.
[03:17] Hasn't been pushed in fully.
[03:19] And therefore won't form a circuit.
[03:22] We've got short circuits.
[03:23] The wires have been damaged and the insulation have been stripped off.
[03:26] And we've got a short circuit between two wires.
[03:28] And we can collect.
[03:29] Can we can accept splice wires two or three or more more ends.
[03:34] And fly leads.
[03:35] And so at the very bottom is a typical screen we would run.
[03:40] And you'll notice it.
[03:41] It's this is sitting on a 22 inch screen in front of an operator who's testing.
[03:46] They don't need to look up.
[03:47] They can see their peripheral vision either red or green.
[03:51] And they know there's no mistaking that they didn't read the test set.
[03:55] So we've we've got certain information about there.
[03:58] It's it's what is the model our testing so that they know that the test program is correct for the product they're making.
[04:06] And they can quickly see.
[04:08] And then in the in the red one where it says error code.
[04:13] We sequence the wires if you had 10 wires.

[00:00 - 00:11] So we got started. So Tony Smith is going to join us from us. We're going to.
